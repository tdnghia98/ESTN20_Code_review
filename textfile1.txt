The  (Felis ) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.[1][2] 
It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.

Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to hunt rodents.
About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various  registries.[6]
The dog (Canis familiaris when considered a distinct species or Canis lupus familiaris when considered a subspecies of the wolf)[5] is a domesticated carnivore of the family Canidae.
It is part of the wolf-like canids,[6] and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore.[7][8][9][10][11] 
The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated,[12][13][14] which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct.[15] 
The dog was the first species to be ,[14][16] and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.[17]
